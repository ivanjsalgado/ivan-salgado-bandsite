# Band Site

Band Site is the third project in the BrainStation curriculum, spanning three weeks, with each week representing a dedicated sprint. These weeks were allocated to specific tasks, including the creation and styling of HTML elements, ensuring responsiveness across a range of screen widths from 320px to 1920px, and establishing the connection between the front-end and back-end. The project concluded at the end of the fifth week of the bootcamp. By this point, I was exposed to HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and Web APIs.

The website was designed to be responsive and adapt its layout based on three distinct screen sizes:

Less than 786 pixels: Mobile formatting is applied.
Between 786 pixels and less than 1280 pixels: Tablet formatting is utilized.
More than 1280 pixels: Desktop formatting is implemented.

Technologies used:

- JavaScript
- HTML5
- SCSS
- Axios
